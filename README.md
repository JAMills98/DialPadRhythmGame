# DialPadRhythmGame
A Portrait-Only Rhythm Game for Mobile Gamers

# What is it?
A demonstration/proof-of-concept for a Portrait-Only Game.
The Dial-Pad is a 3x3 grid of buttons, resembling a phone's keypad.

# How to play?
There are nine buttons at the bottom; pressing them will light up the respective column and hit the notes if they're close to bottom.
Automatically, the game will run the demo-song, there is no menu or browsing; this is merely a test song that combines different input types so one can gague how a user interacts.
To go fullscreen, press the Top Right; this is important because there is no Auto-Fullscreen, so this is used to best minimise problems involving fitts law and the top/bottom of screen.
